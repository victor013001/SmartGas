# SmartGas-ESP32-MQ2
Project for the IoT course that uses an ESP32 with an MQ2 module, RGB LED, Buzzer and MQTT protocol

## Project Overview

The project focuses on gas level detection using an ESP32 microcontroller with an MQ2 module, providing visual and auditory alerts through an RGB LED and a buzzer. The system communicates using the MQTT protocol to publish gas values, buzzer status, and servo activation messages for integration with the [SmartGas-ESP32-Servo](https://github.com/victor013001/SmartGas-ESP32-Servo) project.
